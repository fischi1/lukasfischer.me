            <p>
                I currently live in Vienna, Austria. My interest in coding and
                software development started very early with the age of 12,
                thanks to my fascination in video games. Shortly after that I
                started to teach myself HTML and CSS. This also led me to choose
                a technical school career.
            </p>

            <p>
                Iâ€™m interested in front-end, back-end, web and app development,
                UX design, video game dev and computer graphics. This also lead
                to the topics of my matriculation project and bachelor thesis.
