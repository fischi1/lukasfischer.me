                <p>
                    I currently live in Vienna, Austria. My interest in coding
                    and software development started very early with the age of
                    12, thanks to my fascination in video games. Shortly after
                    that I started to teach myself HTML and CSS. This also led
                    me to choose a technical school career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Iâ€™m interested in front-end, back-end, web and app
                    development, UX design, video game dev and computer
                    graphics. This also lead to the topics of my matriculation
                    project and bachelor thesis.
                </p>
