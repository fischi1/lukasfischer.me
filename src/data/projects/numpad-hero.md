This was a solo project aimed to create a prototype for a rhythm game. It originated out of the interest in how to implement a rhythm game and how it could be combined with the satisfactory feeling of typing fluidly on a numpad.

**Numpad Hero** was created with Unity. This allowed me to test not only on PC but also on mobile devices. If played on a phone or tablet the tiles on the screen are touched directly instead of using your keyboard. For devices without a numpad one can just use a 3x3 setup on the letter keys of your keyboard.

As the song progresses, targets appear on the screen on top of the tiles and a small black bar is moving up and down. If the bar hits the center of the target, the corresponding key must be pressed.

If you want to try it, you can play it directly in your browser or download the Windows and Android versions on [itch.io](https://fishynator.itch.io/numpad-hero)
