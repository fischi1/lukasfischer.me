**Welcome!**  
I'm Lukas from Vienna, Austria! A software engineer who understands the importance of UX. Always learning, always improving..

My interest in coding and software development started very early, thanks to my fascination in computers and video games. Shortly after that I started to teach myself HTML and CSS. Everything went hand in hand and led me to choose a technical school career.

I'm interested in a wide range of topics including front-end, back-end, web and app development, UX design, video game dev and computer graphics.
