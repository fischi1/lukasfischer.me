**Welcome!**  
I'm Lukas from Vienna, Austria! A software engineer who has experience developing a variety of software, from business applications to games.

My interest in coding and software development started very early, thanks to my fascination in computers and video games. Shortly after that I started to teach myself HTML and CSS. Everything went hand in hand and led me to choose a technical school career.  
Always learning, always improving...

I'm interested in a wide range of topics including web and app development, UX, video games and computer graphics.
